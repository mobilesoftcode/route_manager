  /// # Usage
  ///
  /// The [RouteManager] must be used to initialize the routing system.
  /// To use it in the root [MaterialApp] routing, instantiate the MaterialApp
  /// with the [MaterialApp.router] constructor and then pass the created
  /// [RouteDelegate] and [InformationParser], as shown in the followin example.
  /// ``` dart
  /// final routeManager = RouteManager(routesInfo: [
  ///   RouteInfo(name: "/", routeWidget: (args) => Container()),
  /// ]);
  ///
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return MaterialApp.router(
  ///     routeInformationParser: routeManager.informationParser,
  ///     routerDelegate: routeManager.routerDelegate,
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// To use another [RouteManager] in app, the [RouterManager] widget can be
  /// similarly used as shown in the following code.
  /// ``` dart
  /// final routeManager = RouteManager(routesInfo: [
  ///   RouteInfo(name: "/home", routeWidget: (args) => Container()),
  /// ]);
  ///
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return RouterManager(
  ///     routeManager: routeManager,
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## RouteDelegate
  ///
  /// The [RouteDelegate] instance to push/pop pages can be accessed by calling
  /// ``` dart
  /// final routeDelegate = RouterManager.of(context);
  /// ```
  /// Note that you need the `context` to use the route delegate. If you want to
  /// use it outside a widget with `context`, you should take care on your own to store an
  /// application's global context, or to share the [RouteManager] instance globally
  /// in the project to access it everywhere. This behaviour is discouraged and
  /// so there is no out-of-the-box implementation for it.
  ///
  /// For other information about [RouteManager] usage, check the class documentation.
